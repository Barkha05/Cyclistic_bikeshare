# Cyclistic_bikeshare
This Project is completed for the Capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In this project Cyclistic is a fictional bikeshare company in Chicago. It is believed that the companyâ€™s future success highly depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. According to the case study, I work as a junior Data Analyst in the Marketing analyst team of the company and my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, in preparation for further designing a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. So, this report is the analysis of how differently these bikes are used by Casual riders and Annual members.
